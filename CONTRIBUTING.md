## How to contribute to IntersectionObserver

* this project is based on the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)
so all changes should ar least comply with that.

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/shopsuite/IntersectionObserver/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/shopsuite/IntersectionObserver/issues/new).
All we need is a clear **title and clear description**, containing as much relevant information as needed to understand and reproduce the issue, perhaps a **code sample**.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read the [Contributing](https://shopsuite.com/contributing.html) guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

#### **Did you only fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

A PR that only contains changes that are cosmetic in nature are not accepted. We are not perfect, we know, but this doesn't add functionality.
I you really want to improve the cosmetics, please also find a bug to fix or feature to add...

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Contact us for feedback on the feature and start writing code, you don't need approval to write code!

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are intended for bug reports and fixes.

We love that you want to pitch in [Team](https://github.com/shopsuite/IntersectionObserver/contributors)!
